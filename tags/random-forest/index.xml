      <description>Intro First of all we are going to load required packages and the data. The data is part of the mlr3data package.
library(&amp;quot;mlr3&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3learners&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3pipelines&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3data&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3misc&amp;quot;) data(&amp;quot;titanic&amp;quot;) The titanic data is very interesting to analyze, even though it is part of many tutorials and showcases. This is because it requires many steps often required in real-world applications of machine learning techniques, such as feature engineering, missing value imputation, handling factors and others.</description>

      <description>Intro This is the first part in a serial of tutorials. The other parts of this series can be found here:
 Part II - Pipelines Part III - Tuning  mlr3 is a machine learning framework for R. Together with other packages from the same developers, mostly following the naming scheme &#34;mlr3___&#34;, it offers functionality around developing, tuning, and evaluating machine learning workflows.
We will walk through this tutorial interactively.</description>

      <description>The use-case illustrated below touches on the following concepts:
 Data preprocessing Task Fitting a learner Resampling Tuning  The relevant sections in the mlr3book are linked to for the reader’s convenience.
This use case shows how to model housing price data in King County. Following features are illustrated:
 Summarizing the data set Converting data to treat it as a numeric feature/factor Generating new variables Splitting data into train and test data sets Computing a first model (decision tree) Building many trees (random forest) Visualizing price data across different region Optimizing the baseline by implementing a tuner Engineering features Creating a sparser model  House Price Prediction in King County We use the kc_housing dataset contained in the package mlr3book in order to provide a use-case for the application of mlr3 on real-world data.</description>
